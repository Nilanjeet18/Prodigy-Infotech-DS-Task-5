# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 5:

Welcome to my submission for Task 5 of the Data Science Internship at `Prodigy Infotech`. In this task, I have performed Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization
- warnings


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. **Visualization**: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

3. **Warnings**: hese warnings can help identify problems early but can also be suppressed or filtered when they are not critical to the analysis, ensuring the workflow remains focused and uninterrupted.



## Conclusion

In conclusion, Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.
